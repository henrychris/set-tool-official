# Set Tool

Manage sets when playing sports. Add as many teams as you'd like.

## Development

Run `npm install`.
Run `npx tsc index.ts` to transpile to javascript. Add the `--watch` flag to auto update on changes to the Typescript file.

Install _Live Server_ or _Live Preview_ extension. Open the index.html file in the browser with the extension to see updates as you make them.

If you'd rather not use the extension, you can open the index.html file in the browser without it. Refresh the page to see updates.

## Usage

1. Open the index.html file in the browser.
2. Add teams.
3. Refresh the page to reset.
